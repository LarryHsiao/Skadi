# Build & Publish Native macOS Release

Bumps the version, commits, pushes, builds a native macOS Xcode project, exports a signed artifact, and publishes it to the configured target (GitHub Releases or Mac App Store). Tags the commit on success.

The publish target is remembered per-project in `./.claude/publish-macos-target`. First run asks. Later runs run silently unless the user overrides with `--github`, `--app-store`, or `--target=<…>`.

## Arguments

`/publish-macos [scheme] [--no-bump] [--github|--app-store|--target=<github|app-store>]`

- `scheme`: Xcode scheme to build. Auto-detected if omitted.
- `--no-bump`: Skip version bump, commit, push, and tagging. Build and publish only.
- `--github` / `--app-store` / `--target=<github|app-store>`: Publish target override. Persists to the per-project target file. If none is given and no file exists, the skill asks once.

## Workflow

### 1. Verify Xcode project

```bash
ls *.xcworkspace 2>/dev/null || ls *.xcodeproj 2>/dev/null
```

If neither found, stop:

> Not a native macOS project — no .xcworkspace or .xcodeproj found.

### 2. Detect scheme

If no scheme argument, list schemes:

```bash
xcodebuild -list 2>/dev/null
```

Pick the first non-test scheme (does not end in `Tests` or `UITests`). If multiple, use AskUserQuestion.

### 3. Resolve publish target

Priority:

1. **CLI arg** — `--github`, `--app-store`, or `--target=<value>`. Persist it:
   ```bash
   ~/.claude/hooks/publish-macos-target.sh set <github|app-store>
   ```
2. **Stored file** — otherwise read:
   ```bash
   ~/.claude/hooks/publish-macos-target.sh get
   ```
   If non-empty, use it silently. Do **not** mention the target until step 12 unless the user asks.
3. **First run** — if no arg and no stored value, use AskUserQuestion:

   ```
   question: "Where should this project publish to?"
   options:
     - label: "GitHub Releases"
       description: "Upload DMG / notarized .app to a new GitHub release"
     - label: "Mac App Store"
       description: "Upload .pkg to App Store Connect via altool"
   ```

   Save the choice:
   ```bash
   ~/.claude/hooks/publish-macos-target.sh set <github|app-store>
   ```

Hold the resolved target as `TARGET` for later steps.

### 4. Bump version (skip if `--no-bump`)

```bash
agvtool what-marketing-version -terse1 | tail -n 1 | tr -d ' '
```

If `agvtool` reports versioning isn't configured, stop:

> `agvtool` is not configured for this project. Enable Apple Generic Versioning, or re-run with `--no-bump`.

Ask which part to bump:

```
question: "Current version: CURRENT. Which part to bump?"
options:
  - label: "Patch"    description: "X.Y.Z → X.Y.(Z+1)"
  - label: "Minor"    description: "X.Y.Z → X.(Y+1).0"
  - label: "Major"    description: "X.Y.Z → (X+1).0.0"
```

Apply:

```bash
agvtool new-marketing-version NEW_VERSION
agvtool next-version -all
```

Confirm:

```
question: "Bumped to NEW_VERSION. Commit and push?"
options:
  - label: "Commit and push"  description: "rtk git add -A && rtk git commit && rtk git push"
  - label: "Stop"             description: "Leave the working tree dirty and exit"
```

Stop if rejected.

**Stamp the changelog** (best-effort — skip silently if no `CHANGELOG.md` at repo root):

- Find the heading line for `NEW_VERSION` (matches `## [NEW_VERSION]` or `## NEW_VERSION`, with or without surrounding brackets).
- If that line contains an in-progress marker (case-insensitive: `in-progress`, `in progress`, `unreleased`, `wip`, `tbd`), replace the marker with today's date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format. Preserve the surrounding separator (`—`, `-`, `(`, etc.).
- If no matching heading exists, or the heading has no in-progress marker, leave the file alone.
- If multiple headings match the version, only stamp the first and report the others.

Then commit everything together:

```bash
rtk git add -A
rtk git commit -m "chore: bump version to NEW_VERSION"
rtk git push
```

Remember `NEW_VERSION` for steps 11 and 12.

### 5. Confirm before building

```
question: "Build release archive for scheme: SCHEME?"
options:
  - label: "Build"
    description: "xcodebuild archive → export → publish"
```

Stop if rejected.

### 6. Prepare output directory

```bash
rm -rf build/publish
mkdir -p build/publish
```

### 6.5. Resolve Apple credentials

Needed by both targets (github needs them to sign/notarize; app-store needs them for `altool`). Resolve `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_TEAM_ID`, `APPLE_APP_PASSWORD` in this order:

1. **Bitwarden** — if `bw` is installed and unlocked:
   ```bash
   bw get item "Apple Notarization"
   ```
   `login.username` → `APPLE_ID`, `login.password` → `APPLE_APP_PASSWORD`, custom field `team_id` → `APPLE_TEAM_ID`.

2. **Memory** — check saved memory.

3. **Env vars** — `$APPLE_ID`, `$APPLE_TEAM_ID`, `$APPLE_APP_PASSWORD`.

4. **Project fallback for `APPLE_TEAM_ID` only** — if still empty, read from the Xcode build settings:
   ```bash
   xcodebuild -showBuildSettings -scheme SCHEME 2>/dev/null \
     | awk '/^[[:space:]]*DEVELOPMENT_TEAM = / {print $3; exit}'
   ```

If `bw` is installed but locked (`bw status` returns `locked`):

> Bitwarden vault is locked. Run `bw unlock` and set `BW_SESSION`, or provide credentials another way.

If any of `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_TEAM_ID`, `APPLE_APP_PASSWORD` is still missing:

> Publishing requires APPLE_ID, APPLE_TEAM_ID, and APPLE_APP_PASSWORD. Provide via Bitwarden, memory, env vars, or (for APPLE_TEAM_ID) DEVELOPMENT_TEAM in the Xcode project.

Hold the resolved values in env for the rest of the workflow.

### 7. Archive

Use `-workspace` if a `.xcworkspace` exists, else `-project`.

**If `TARGET == github`** (Developer ID signing — required so Gatekeeper accepts the DMG after download. Ad-hoc signing fails with "is damaged" once the quarantine bit is set):

```bash
xcodebuild archive \
  -workspace *.xcworkspace \
  -scheme SCHEME \
  -configuration Release \
  -archivePath build/publish/SCHEME.xcarchive \
  CODE_SIGN_STYLE=Manual \
  CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application" \
  DEVELOPMENT_TEAM="$APPLE_TEAM_ID" \
  | xcpretty || cat
```

**If `TARGET == app-store`** (let the project's own signing config handle it — Apple Distribution + provisioning profile are required):

```bash
xcodebuild archive \
  -workspace *.xcworkspace \
  -scheme SCHEME \
  -configuration Release \
  -archivePath build/publish/SCHEME.xcarchive \
  | xcpretty || cat
```

Swap `-workspace *.xcworkspace` for `-project *.xcodeproj` if only the project exists.

Stop on failure and show the last 30 lines.

### 8. Export

**If `TARGET == github`:**

```bash
cat > /tmp/ExportOptions.plist << EOF
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>method</key>
    <string>developer-id</string>
    <key>teamID</key>
    <string>$APPLE_TEAM_ID</string>
    <key>signingStyle</key>
    <string>manual</string>
</dict>
</plist>
EOF

xcodebuild -exportArchive \
  -archivePath build/publish/SCHEME.xcarchive \
  -exportPath build/publish/export \
  -exportOptionsPlist /tmp/ExportOptions.plist
```

Then go to step 9.

**If `TARGET == app-store`:**

```bash
cat > /tmp/ExportOptions.plist << 'EOF'
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>method</key>
    <string>app-store</string>
</dict>
</plist>
EOF

xcodebuild -exportArchive \
  -archivePath build/publish/SCHEME.xcarchive \
  -exportPath build/publish/export \
  -exportOptionsPlist /tmp/ExportOptions.plist
```

The export dir will contain `SCHEME.pkg`. Skip to step 10.

Stop on failure.

### 9. Package for GitHub (only when `TARGET == github`)

Check for `create-dmg`:

```bash
which create-dmg
```

**If found:**

```bash
create-dmg \
  --volname "SCHEME" \
  --window-pos 200 120 \
  --window-size 600 400 \
  --icon-size 100 \
  --app-drop-link 450 185 \
  "build/publish/SCHEME.dmg" \
  "build/publish/export/"
```

Then notarize and staple the DMG so Gatekeeper accepts it after download (Apple creds were resolved in step 6.5):

```bash
xcrun notarytool submit "build/publish/SCHEME.dmg" \
  --apple-id "$APPLE_ID" \
  --team-id "$APPLE_TEAM_ID" \
  --password "$APPLE_APP_PASSWORD" \
  --wait

xcrun stapler staple "build/publish/SCHEME.dmg"
```

Stop on notarization failure and show the submission log via `xcrun notarytool log <submission-id> --apple-id … --team-id … --password …`.

Set `ARTIFACT=build/publish/SCHEME.dmg`. Go to step 10.

**If not found:** ask:

```
question: "create-dmg not installed. How do you want to proceed?"
options:
  - label: "Notarize .app"
    description: "Notarize & staple the .app, zip it, attach to the release"
  - label: "Stop here"
    description: "Keep the exported .app and exit (no publish, no tag)"
```

If "Stop here": report location and exit.

If "Notarize .app" (Apple creds were resolved in step 6.5):

```bash
ditto -c -k --keepParent \
  "build/publish/export/SCHEME.app" \
  "build/publish/SCHEME.zip"

xcrun notarytool submit "build/publish/SCHEME.zip" \
  --apple-id "$APPLE_ID" \
  --team-id "$APPLE_TEAM_ID" \
  --password "$APPLE_APP_PASSWORD" \
  --wait

xcrun stapler staple "build/publish/export/SCHEME.app"

rm -f "build/publish/SCHEME.zip"
ditto -c -k --keepParent \
  "build/publish/export/SCHEME.app" \
  "build/publish/SCHEME.zip"
```

Set `ARTIFACT=build/publish/SCHEME.zip`.

### 10. Publish

Apple creds (`APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_TEAM_ID`, `APPLE_APP_PASSWORD`) were resolved in step 6.5 and are already in env.

#### If `TARGET == github`

Require `gh` authenticated (`gh auth status`). If not, stop with instructions.

```bash
rtk gh release create "vNEW_VERSION" \
  "ARTIFACT" \
  --title "vNEW_VERSION" \
  --generate-notes
```

If `--no-bump` is in effect, ask the user for a release name (or default to the most recent tag incremented).

#### If `TARGET == app-store`

Upload the `.pkg`:

```bash
xcrun altool --upload-app \
  --type macos \
  --file "build/publish/export/SCHEME.pkg" \
  --username "$APPLE_ID" \
  --password "$APPLE_APP_PASSWORD"
```

Stop on failure. On success, the build is in App Store Connect awaiting processing — submission/review is manual from there.

### 11. Tag the commit (skip if `--no-bump`)

Only after publishing succeeds:

```bash
rtk git tag "vNEW_VERSION"
rtk git push origin "vNEW_VERSION"
```

If tagging fails (e.g. tag exists), report but don't roll back the published artifact.

Note: for `TARGET == github`, `gh release create` already creates the tag remotely. Check before re-tagging:

```bash
rtk git fetch --tags
rtk git tag -l "vNEW_VERSION"
```

If the tag already exists locally/remotely from the release, skip this step.

### 12. Report

```
Build complete:
  version  →  NEW_VERSION                         ← if bumped
  archive  →  build/publish/SCHEME.xcarchive
  artifact →  build/publish/SCHEME.dmg | .zip | .pkg
  target   →  github | app-store
  publish  →  https://github.com/.../releases/tag/vNEW_VERSION   ← github
           →  App Store Connect (awaiting processing)             ← app-store
  tag      →  vNEW_VERSION pushed                                 ← if bumped

All artifacts in build/publish/
```

## Rules

- Prefer `.xcworkspace` over `.xcodeproj` when both exist.
- Use `xcpretty` for archive output if available.
- Stop on first failure; show last 30 lines of build log.
- Version bump → build → publish → tag. Never tag before publish succeeds.
- `--no-bump` skips bump/commit/push and tagging. Build and publish still run.
- GitHub path always Developer-ID-signs the archive and notarizes + staples the DMG (or zipped .app). Ad-hoc signing is never used for downloads — Gatekeeper rejects it once quarantine is set.
- App Store path requires proper signing config in the Xcode project (Apple Distribution cert, provisioning profile). The skill does not override signing for this path.
- Target is persisted per-project in `./.claude/publish-macos-target`. Arg flags override and update the stored value. Silent otherwise.
- Never modify other project files beyond what `agvtool` touches.
