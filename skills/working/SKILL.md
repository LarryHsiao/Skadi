description: Use when the user runs /working [JIRA-number] [type] to begin a Jira ticket. Resolves the ticket (prompts a list when none given), checks out an existing feature branch or cuts a new one from the chosen base, transitions the ticket to In Progress in Jira, syncs the local todo list, then pushes the branch and opens a draft PR/MR self-assigned to the author — a GitHub PR via `gh` or a GitLab MR via `glab`, whichever the origin remote points to — when the forge CLI is authenticated.

# Start Working on a Jira Task

Creates and checks out a git branch for a Jira ticket.

## Branch Format

```
JIRA-NUMBER/type/name/description-slug
```

Examples:
```
PROJ-123/feat/larry/add-user-authentication
PROJ-456/chore/larry/update-ci-pipeline
PROJ-789/fix/larry/cannot-close-emergency-measure-page
```

## Workflow

### 1. Parse command arguments and resolve ticket number

- If `JIRA-NUMBER` was provided (e.g., `PROJ-123`), use it and skip the rest of this step.
- If `type` was also provided alongside the ticket (`/working PROJ-123 feat`), record it for step 5 (and skip the prompt there).

**If no ticket number was provided:**

**a. Resolve the project key** (creds are the hook's concern, resolved via `secret.sh`):

1. Check memory file `jira_project.md` for a saved project key.
2. If not found, search git history and branches for a Jira ticket pattern (`[A-Z]+-[0-9]+`):
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -100 2>/dev/null | grep -oE '[A-Z]+-[0-9]+' | head -1
   git branch -a 2>/dev/null | grep -oE '[A-Z]+-[0-9]+' | head -1
   ```
   Extract the project key (e.g. `PROJ` from `PROJ-123`).
3. If still not found, ask the user for the project key via AskUserQuestion, then save to memory:
   - Write to `/Users/larryhsiao/.claude/projects/-Users-larryhsiao-skadi/memory/jira_project.md`
   - Add pointer to `MEMORY.md`

**b. Fetch open/in-progress tickets for the project** and present them for selection:

```bash
~/.claude/hooks/working-jira-open.sh PROJECT_KEY 20
```

The hook resolves Jira creds via `secret.sh` and prints a JSON array, most-recently-updated first:
`[{"key":"ELROND-148","status":"To Do","summary":"..."}]`. On failure it prints `{"error":"..."}`.

Present the results via AskUserQuestion (up to 4 options; if more than 4, show the first 4 — already the most recently updated — and offer "Other" for manual entry). Use the ticket key + summary as the label.

Set the chosen ticket as `JIRA-NUMBER` and continue.

### 2. Check for existing branch

Before fetching any Jira data, check if a branch for this ticket already exists:

```bash
git branch -a --format='%(refname:short)' | grep -iE '(^|/)JIRA-NUMBER/'
```

The `(^|/)JIRA-NUMBER/` anchor matches the ticket key only as a whole branch segment — `PROJ-12` will not match `PROJ-123/...`. The trailing `/` is the branch-format separator (`JIRA-NUMBER/type/...`).

- **No matches** → continue to step 3.
- **Exactly one match** → check it out and stop:
  ```bash
  git checkout <branch>
  git pull
  ```
- **Multiple matches** → present them via AskUserQuestion, let the user pick one, check it out with `git pull`, then stop.

If the user picks an existing branch, the workflow ends here — no Jira API calls, no new branch.

### 3. Get Jira ticket description

Fetch the ticket fields through the hook — it resolves Jira creds via `secret.sh` (Vaultwarden first, env fallback), so no token need live in the skill:

```bash
~/.claude/hooks/working-jira-ticket.sh JIRA-NUMBER
```

It pulls `summary`, `status`, `description`, `priority`, and `issuetype` in one call and prints a single JSON object — the brief in step 8e needs all five. The description arrives flattened from ADF (Atlassian Document Format) to plain text:

```json
{"summary":"...","status":"...","type":"...","priority":"...","description":"..."}
```

On failure it prints `{"error":"...","response":"..."}`.

Stash all five values for use in the step 4 transition (status), the step 8e brief (everything), and the step 8f PR/MR title (summary).

If the hook returns an error, fall back to asking:
> "What is the Jira ticket title/description for [JIRA-NUMBER]?"

When the error names missing credentials, also tell the user:
> Jira creds resolve via `secret.sh` — store a Vaultwarden item `jira` (uri / username / password), or set `JIRA_API_TOKEN` in your environment. An Atlassian API token comes from https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens

### 4. Transition ticket to "in progress"

Throughout this step the **in-progress keyword set** is `progress`, `doing`, `active`, `start`, `working` (case-insensitive substring match — `start` also catches "started").

Skip this step entirely if the current status (stashed in step 3) already contains one of those keywords.

**a. Check memory for a saved transition** (`jira_transition_PROJECTKEY.md`, where PROJECTKEY is the project part of the ticket number, e.g. `ELROND`):
- If a transition ID is saved, use it directly — go to step 4c.

**b. Fetch available transitions** through the hook:

```bash
~/.claude/hooks/working-jira-transitions.sh JIRA-NUMBER
```

It prints a JSON array `[{"id":"42","name":"Doing","to":"Doing"}]` (creds via `secret.sh`); on failure, `{"error":"..."}`.

- Identify candidates whose name contains a keyword from the in-progress set.
- If exactly one candidate is found, use it automatically.
- If multiple candidates are found, present them via AskUserQuestion and let the user pick.
- If no candidates are found, present all available transitions via AskUserQuestion.
- After the user picks, save the chosen transition ID to memory:
  - Write to `/Users/larryhsiao/.claude/projects/-Users-larryhsiao-skadi/memory/jira_transition_PROJECTKEY.md`
  - Add pointer to `MEMORY.md` (only if not already listed)

**c. Apply the transition** through the hook — idempotent, so it no-ops when the ticket is already in the target status:

```bash
~/.claude/hooks/jira-state.sh JIRA-NUMBER TRANSITION_ID
```

It prints `transitioned: id=… status=…->…` on success, `noop: id=… status=…` when already there, or `{"error":"..."}` on failure. Confirm silently — surface only an error.

**d. Sync the todo list:**

Call **TaskList** and look for a task whose `metadata.jira_key == JIRA-NUMBER`.

- Found → **TaskUpdate** `status=in_progress`.
- Not found → **TaskCreate** with:
  - `subject`: `JIRA-NUMBER — SUMMARY` (truncate to ~55 chars)
  - `description`: `<jira-uri>/browse/JIRA-NUMBER` (jira-uri from `~/.claude/hooks/secret.sh jira uri`)
  - `metadata`: `{ "jira_key": "JIRA-NUMBER" }`
  - Then **TaskUpdate** it to `in_progress`.

Silent on success.

### 5. Ask for type (if not provided)

Use AskUserQuestion:
- `feat` — new feature or user-facing change
- `fix` — bug fix
- `chore` — maintenance, dependency update, refactor, CI, etc.

### 6. Get the user's name/handle

- Check memory file `user_jira_name.md` for a saved name — if found, use it silently, do NOT ask
- If not saved, ask once: "What name/handle should appear in branch names?" then save it:
  - Write to `/Users/larryhsiao/.claude/projects/-Users-larryhsiao-skadi/memory/user_jira_name.md`
  - Add pointer to `MEMORY.md`
- Only re-ask if the user explicitly says to change it (e.g. "change my name", "use a different handle")

### 7. Slugify the description

- If not in English, translate to English first
- Lowercase everything
- Replace spaces and special characters with `-`
- Remove characters that aren't alphanumeric or `-`
- Trim leading/trailing `-`
- Truncate to ~50 characters at a word boundary

### 8. Choose base branch and create feature branch

**a. Load default dev branch from memory** (`dev_branch.md`):
- If not saved, ask: "What is the default dev branch for this project? (e.g. `dev`, `develop`, `main`)"
  - Save the answer to `/Users/larryhsiao/.claude/projects/-Users-larryhsiao-skadi/memory/dev_branch.md`
  - Add pointer to `MEMORY.md`
- Only re-ask if the user explicitly says to change it

**b. Ask which branch to start from** using AskUserQuestion (skip if user is switching to an existing branch):
- Default option: the remembered dev branch (from memory)
- Let the user pick a different branch or type a custom one

**c. Checkout and pull the chosen base branch:**

```bash
git checkout <chosen-branch>
git pull
```

**d. Create the feature branch:**

```bash
git checkout -b JIRA-NUMBER/type/name/description-slug
```

**e. Brief the ticket:**

Render a tight ticket card in chat so the user is oriented before they start coding. Use the values stashed in step 3.

```
─ JIRA-NUMBER ───────────────────────────
**<summary>**
<type> · <priority> · <status> · <branch-name>

<description, truncated to 800 chars; append "..." if cut>
─────────────────────────────────────────
```

Truncate the description at the nearest whitespace at-or-before 800 chars (don't cut mid-word). If any of `type`, `priority`, or `status` is empty, omit it from the metadata line — keep the dots clean.

**f. Push the branch and open a draft PR/MR — host-agnostic:**

Detect the forge from the origin remote, then hand the push and draft-open to the matching forge hook. Each hook pushes the branch, opens the PR/MR self-assigned to `@me`, and prints one line — `opened: forge=<github|gitlab> url=<url> number=<n>` — or `{"error":"..."}` on failure. The two hooks share one argument contract, so the skill is forge-blind below the detection.

```bash
origin=$(git remote get-url origin)
```

Pick the hook from the remote — both share one argument contract, so the rest of the step is forge-blind:

- `origin` contains `gitlab` → `FORGE_HOOK=~/.claude/hooks/forge-gitlab-mr.sh`
- `origin` contains `github` → `FORGE_HOOK=~/.claude/hooks/forge-github-pr.sh`
- otherwise → skip the push and PR/MR; tell the user the forge wasn't recognized. The feature branch is already created locally regardless.

Build a short draft body (the ticket link and summary — the work isn't done yet, so the body fills out at review time) and invoke the chosen hook with the body on stdin, targeting the base branch from step 8b:

```bash
jira_uri=$(~/.claude/hooks/secret.sh jira uri 2>/dev/null)
printf 'Jira: %s/browse/JIRA-NUMBER\n\n%s\n' "$jira_uri" "TICKET_SUMMARY" \
  | "$FORGE_HOOK" \
      JIRA-NUMBER/type/name/description-slug \
      BASE_BRANCH \
      "[JIRA-NUMBER] type: Ticket summary" \
      --draft --assignee @me
```

- **Title** format: `[JIRA-NUMBER] type: <ticket summary>` — the original ticket summary (not the slug), sentence-case.
- **Base**: the branch chosen in step 8b.
- The hook self-checks that `gh`/`glab` is installed and authenticated; on a missing CLI or failed auth it prints `{"error":"..."}` — surface that and stop. The branch is created locally either way.
- Read the `opened:` line and show the user the PR/MR URL.

## Rules

- Jira number: preserve case as given (e.g., `PROJ-123`, not `proj-123`)
- Type: must be exactly `feat`, `fix`, or `chore`
- Name: lowercase, from memory
- Description: English slug only — no spaces, no special chars, hyphens between words
