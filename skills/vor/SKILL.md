name: vor
description: Use when the user runs /vor. Reads new Microsoft Teams messages from the conversations they belong to (read-only, via Graph delta), organizes the traffic — clustering threads, surfacing @-mentions and direct questions, collapsing noise — and suggests draft replies in-session. It never posts to Teams. Dormant until the work tenant grants Chat.Read/ChannelMessage.Read.All and a vor-graph-token secret exists.
purpose: Surfaces Teams threads needing a reply and suggests drafts.

# Vör — Teams Watchman

Vör watches the Teams conversations you belong to and helps you keep pace: it
reads what is new, organizes it, and suggests how you might reply. **It reads and
advises. It never posts.** You keep a hand on every send.

## Verb

`/vor` — fetch, organize, suggest.

## Steps

1. **Fetch.** Run the poller and capture its output and exit code:

   ```bash
   ~/.claude/hooks/vor-teams-poll.sh
   ```

   Handle the exit code before anything else:
   - `2` — dormant. Tell the user plainly what is missing (no `sources.txt`, or no
     `vor-graph-token`) and stop. This is expected until tenant consent lands.
   - `3` — a tool (`jq`/`curl`) is missing. Name it and ask the user to install it.
   - `4` — Graph denied or errored. Relay that consent for
     `Chat.Read`/`ChannelMessage.Read.All` is not yet granted, and stop.
   - `0` — proceed. The stdout is a JSON array of normalized messages
     (`{id, sender, text, thread, timestamp, mentionsMe}`); an empty array means
     nothing new.

2. **Organize.** Read the messages and group them by `thread`. Surface, in this
   order: threads where `mentionsMe` is true, then threads that ask a direct
   question, then the rest collapsed into a one-line "routine" tally. Drop pure
   noise (joins, reactions, automated notices).

3. **Suggest.** For each surfaced thread that wants a reply, draft a short
   suggested response in-session for the user to read and copy. **Do not send it.
   There is no send path, and you must not construct one.**

4. **Surface.** Render a tight brief: the flagged threads with their suggested
   drafts, then the routine tally. If three or more threads want a reply and the
   user may be away, send one `PushNotification` ("N Teams threads need a reply").

## Read-only guarantee

Vör issues only Graph `GET` calls. It has no write scope, no post verb, and no
`announce`. Never add one to this skill — posting is explicitly out of scope.

## Configuration (once consent exists)

- `~/.skadi/vor/sources.txt` — one Graph delta URL per watched channel/chat.
- `~/.skadi/vor/me.id` — the user's Graph object id (for `mentionsMe`).
- Secret `vor-graph-token` — the Graph bearer token, via Vaultwarden / `secret.sh`.
